        "Here's a breakdown of its significance and important considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Resource Cleanup: The primary purpose of __del__ is to release external resources held by an object. This can include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Closing files: Ensuring that open files are properly closed to prevent data loss or corruption.\n",
        "Releasing network connections: Terminating active network connections to free up resources.\n",
        "Unlocking resources: Releasing locks or semaphores acquired by the object.\n",
        "Releasing memory not managed by Python: If the object has allocated memory using external libraries (like C extensions), __del__ can be used to free that memory.\n",
        "Finalization Logic: In some cases, you might want to perform certain final actions or log information just before an object is destroyed. __del__ can be used for such finalization tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important Considerations and Caveats:\n",
        "\n",
        "While __del__ seems like a straightforward way to handle cleanup, it comes with several important caveats and is generally not recommended for reliable resource management in most situations. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unpredictable Timing: The exact time when __del__ is called is not guaranteed. Garbage collection in Python is automatic and depends on various factors. You cannot rely on __del__ being called immediately when an object is no longer referenced. This makes it unsuitable for critical resource management where timely release is essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "Potential for Circular References: If objects involved in a circular reference (where they refer to each other, preventing their reference count from dropping to zero) have __del__ methods, it can prevent the garbage collector from breaking the cycle and calling these methods. This can lead to memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exceptions During __del__: If an exception occurs within the __del__ method, it is silently ignored by the Python runtime (as of Python 3.8 and earlier; later versions might log a warning). This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging very difficult, as cleanup actions might not be completed without any indication of an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object Resurrection: It's theoretically possible for an object's __del__ method to resurrect the object by creating a new reference to it. However, this is generally considered bad practice and can lead to very complex and unpredictable behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interaction with Interpreter Shutdown: __del__ methods might not be called reliably during interpreter shutdown.\n",
        "\n",
        "Better Alternatives for Resource Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the unreliability of __del__, Python provides more robust and recommended mechanisms for managing resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "with statement and Context Managers: For resources that need to be acquired and released in a structured way (like files, network connections, locks), the with statement along with context managers (implemented using __enter__ and __exit__ methods) is the preferred approach. The __exit__ method of a context manager is guaranteed to be called, even if exceptions occur within the with block, ensuring proper resource cleanup."

        " You can easily add new types of animals (new subclasses of Animal) without modifying the existing animal_sound() function or the loop. The new animal objects will automatically respond to the speak() method in their own way.\n",
        "Loose Coupling: Polymorphism reduces the dependencies between different parts of your code. The animal_sound() function doesn't need to know the specific type of animal it's dealing with; it only needs to know that it has a speak() method.\n",

        "In essence, polymorphism with inheritance in Python allows you to write code that is more adaptable, reusable, and easier to maintain by treating objects of different but related classes in a uniform manner, while still allowing them to exhibit their own unique behaviors. It's a cornerstone of object-oriented design principles.\n",

        "Expressiveness: It can make the intent of the code clearer, especially when the operations are logically connected.\n",
        "When to Use Method Chaining:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is particularly useful when:\n",
        "\n",
        "You are performing a series of modifications or operations on a single object.\n",
        "The methods naturally lend themselves to a sequential flow.\n",

        "Examples in Python Libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll often see method chaining used in various Python libraries, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pandas: For data manipulation (e.g., .groupby().agg().sort_values()).\n",
        "SQLAlchemy: For building database queries.\n",
        "Logging: For configuring loggers.\n",
        "Custom Builder Patterns: When implementing a builder pattern to construct complex objects step by step.\n",
        "Important Considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Not all methods should be chained: Only methods that logically operate on the object and can meaningfully return the object itself are suitable for chaining. Methods that return a different type of value (e.g., a boolean, a string, or another object) would typically be the end of a chain.\n",
        "Potential for reduced debuggability (in some cases): If a chain of operations fails, it might be slightly harder to pinpoint exactly which step caused the issue compared to having separate statements with intermediate variables. However, good error handling and logging can mitigate this.\n",
        "In summary, method chaining in Python OOP is a powerful technique that enhances code readability and conciseness by allowing you to call multiple methods on the same object sequentially, provided that each method (except potentially the last) returns the object instance (self). It's a common and useful pattern for expressing a series of operations on an object in a fluent and expressive way."

        "The Sparrow class inherits from the Bird class.\n",
        "It overrides the fly() method to provide a specific behavior for sparrows: \"Sparrow is fluttering its wings and flying.\"\n",
        "Penguin Class (Derived Class):\n",
        "\n",
        "The Penguin class also inherits from the Bird class.\n",
        "It overrides the fly() method to reflect the fact that penguins cannot fly but are excellent swimmers: \"Penguins can't fly, but they can swim very well!\"\n",
        "bird_action() Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "This function takes an object of type Bird as an argument.\n",
        "It then calls the fly() method on the passed bird object.\n",
        "Polymorphism in Action: The beauty here is that the bird_action() function doesn't need to know the specific type of bird it's dealing with. It simply calls the fly() method. Python's runtime polymorphism ensures that the correct fly() method (the one defined in the actual object's class) is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Demonstration:\n",
        "\n",
        "We create instances of Sparrow, Penguin, and Bird.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we pass each of these objects to the bird_action() function, the appropriate fly() method is called based on the object's actual type. The sparrow flies, the penguin mentions its swimming ability instead of flying, and the generic bird gives a generic flying message.\n",
        "\n",
        "The list of birds further illustrates this. The same bird_action() call within the loop results in different behaviors depending on whether the current bird is a Sparrow, a Penguin, or a Bird.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example clearly demonstrates how polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way, as long as they share a common interface (in this case, the fly() method). The actual behavior of the method call is determined by the object's specific type at runtime."

        "withdraw(self, amount): This method allows withdrawing a positive amount from the account, provided there is sufficient balance. It updates the __balance and includes checks for invalid withdrawal amounts and insufficient balance.\n",

        "Data Hiding:\n",
        "\n",

        "The @staticmethod decorator indicates that this is a static method.\n",

        "This method takes two numbers (num1, num2) as arguments and returns their difference.\n",
